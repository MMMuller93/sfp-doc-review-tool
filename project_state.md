# Doc Review Tool - Project State

> **Status**: Initial setup
> **Last Updated**: 2025-12-30
> **Process Mode**: Full Process (multi-session expected)

---

## Prime Directives

This project follows:
- **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** - Core engineering principles (investigate, understand, clarify, match patterns, minimum viable)
- **CLAUDE_BEST_PRACTICES.md** - Two-agent pattern for long-running work

**Key Principles to Maintain**:
- ✓ Work on ONE feature at a time
- ✓ Never remove/edit features in features.json, only update `passes` field
- ✓ Test end-to-end before marking features complete
- ✓ Commit after each feature with clear message
- ✓ Update this file before ending each session

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**:
1. Define what the Doc Review Tool should do
2. Choose tech stack
3. Initialize project structure
4. Create features.json with feature list
5. Create init.sh for environment setup

## Session Log

### Session 1 - 2025-12-30
- Created project_state.md
- Established Full Process mode for multi-session work
- Ready for project definition and planning

## Notes

- This is a new project - needs initial scope definition
- Following two-agent pattern: will need Initializer phase then Coding phase
- State file ready for continuous updates as work progresses
